## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  m <- NULL
  set <- funtion(y) {
          x <<- y
          m <- NULL
  }
  
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
